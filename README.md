# AI-vs-Normal-Music-
In this project, there are over 200+ self generated AI and Normal music. The problem statement was classiying between then using RNNs. 
The data was converted to WAV format and then spectrogram and MFCC images were developed from the above audio files. 
They were theen labelled and one hot encoded and fed into a combination of CNN and LSTM layered neural network and an accuracy of over 80.23% was achieved.
